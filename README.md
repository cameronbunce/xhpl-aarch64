# xhpl-aarch64 
## Compiled [HPL (High-Performance Linpack Benchmark)](https://netlib.org/benchmark/hpl/) for Linux on ARM64 (AARCH64)

[HPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LINPACK_benchmarks) is used by [top500.org](https://www.top500.org/) to rank the world fastest supercomputers by [FLOPs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FLOPS) (floating points operations per second). It can also be used to test the stability of your CPU, CPU frequency throttling (you either observe the actual frequency or you can tell by lower FLOPs), CPU cache, RAM, and the power supply as the HPL is quite demanding and does also the result verification (see PASSED/FAILED below). On the other hand, HPL is not so good for testing the maximum temperature. The CPU gets really hot during the calculation phase, but it cools down a bit during the verification phase.

The best FLOPs for ARM64 (probably for other archs as well) are obtained using [OpenBLAS library](https://www.openblas.net/), but do not use the library compiled by your distribution. For better results compile it yourself or use the provided binaries. Alternatively one can use [BLIS libraries](https://github.com/flame/blis), [ARM Performance Libraries](https://developer.arm.com/downloads/-/arm-performance-libraries) or any other BLAS implementation, but it may result in fewer FLOPs.

## How to compile yourself

### Compile OpenBLAS
```
wget https://github.com/xianyi/OpenBLAS/archive/refs/tags/v0.3.23.tar.gz
tar xvf v0.3.23.tar.gz
cd OpenBLAS-0.3.23
export NO_SHARED=1
export TARGET=CORTEXA53
NO_FORTRAN=1 NUM_THREADS=8 USE_OPENMP=1 make -j$(nproc)
make test
make PREFIX=${HOME}/openblas install
```
The possible TARGETs are listed in file the `TargetList.txt`. For us are relevant: *ARMV8*, *CORTEXA53*, *CORTEXA55*, *CORTEXA57*, *CORTEXA72*, *CORTEXA73*, and *NEOVERSEN1* (good for CORTEX-A76, 77, and 78?).

We do not need anymore to deleted the shared libraries (so) in order to link the OpenBLAS statically to the final xhpl binary, as the `NO_SHARED=1` takes care of them.

It is also posible to use `DYNAMIC_ARCH=1` to compile all the supported CPUs into one library. Also specify the maximum number of threads by using `NUM_THREADS=8`.

```
wget https://github.com/xianyi/OpenBLAS/archive/refs/tags/v0.3.23.tar.gz
tar xvf v0.3.23.tar.gz
cd OpenBLAS-0.3.23
export NO_SHARED=1
export TARGET=ARMV8
export DYNAMIC_ARCH=1
NO_FORTRAN=1 NUM_THREADS=8 USE_OPENMP=1 make -j$(nproc)
make test
make PREFIX=${HOME}/openblas install
```
### Alternatively compile BLIS
```
wget https://github.com/flame/blis/archive/refs/tags/0.9.0.tar.gz
tar xvf 0.9.0.tar.gz
cd blis-0.9.0
./configure -p ${HOME}/blis --disable-shared -t openmp auto
make -j${nproc}
make check
make install
ln -s ${HOME}/blis/lib/libblis.a ${HOME}/blis/lib/libopenblas.a
```
The *auto* should compile the right library. But the detection algorithm might be wrong. All the possibilities can be displayed by `ls config`. For ARM64 there are *cortexa53*, *cortexa57*, *firestorm* (Apple A14, M1), *thunderx2* (Neoverse N1), and *generic*. Recently, there is also support for configuration families. In that case, use *arm64* all posibilities are compiled in, and the right one is chosen at runtime. But again, the detection migth be wrong. Choose the right library and link it to 

### Compile HPL
```
sudo apt install -y libopenmpi-dev
wget https://www.netlib.org/benchmark/hpl/hpl-2.3.tar.gz
tar xvf hpl-2.3.tar.gz
cd hpl-2.3
```
#### With OpenBLAS
```
LDFLAGS=-L${HOME}/openblas/lib CFLAGS="-pthread -fopenmp" ./configure
make -j$(nproc)
```
#### With BLIS
```
LDFLAGS=-L${HOME}/blis/lib CFLAGS="-fopenmp" ./configure
make -j$(nproc)
```

The resulting binary is `hpl-2.3/testing/xhpl`

It turns out that the OpenBLAS binary for *CORTEX-A53* and *CORTEX-A55* are the same. And *CORTEX-A57* and *CORTEX-A72* are identical as well. It is so because HPL uses just a few functions ([dgemm](https://netlib.org/lapack/explore-html/d1/d54/group__double__blas__level3_gaeda3cbd99c8fb834a60a6412878226e1.html), [daxpy](https://netlib.org/lapack/explore-html/de/da4/group__double__blas__level1_ga8f99d6a644d3396aa32db472e0cfc91c.html),  dcopy, dgemv, dger, dscal, dswap, dtrsm, dtrsv, and idamax) from OpenBLAS, which are for those targets identical.

## Using precompiled binaries

As said above, the *CORTEX-A53* and *CORTEX-A55* are the same as well as the *CORTEX-A57* and *CORTEX-A72* are the same.

You need an openmpi library, even though we will not run it in MPI mode but in OpenMP mode, which automatically will use all the cores. If you want to use MPI, then change P and Q in HPL.dat.
```
sudo apt install openmpi-bin
```
You need to create a text file `HPL.dat` file, for example like this:
```
HPLinpack benchmark input file
Innovative Computing Laboratory, University of Tennessee
HPL.out     output file name (if any)
6           device out (6=stdout,7=stderr,file)

1           # of panels in recursion
2           NDIVs
1           # of recursive panel fact.
2           RFACTs (0=left, 1=Crout, 2=Right)
1           # of broadcast
2           BCASTs (0=1rg,1=1rM,2=2rg,3=2rM,4=Lng,5=LnM)
1           # of lookahead depth
0           DEPTHs (>=0)
2           SWAP (0=bin-exch,1=long,2=mix)
8           swapping threshold
0           L1 in (0=transposed,1=no-transposed) form
0           U  in (0=transposed,1=no-transposed) form
1           Equilibration (0=no,1=yes)
8           memory alignment in double (> 0)
```

The parameter `Ns` is the size of the square matrix Ns Ã— Ns. The memory consumption is thus proportional to Ns^2. Ns=20000 needs around 4GB RAM, for 8GB use 28000, for 2GB use 14000, and for 1GB 10000. Try to use all the RAM as it improves the FLOPs, but you should avoid swapping as it drastically decreased FLOPs.

| RAM (GB)  | optimal Ns |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| 0.5| 7000   |
| 1  | 10000  |
| 2  | 14000  |
| 4  | 20000  |
| 8  | 28000  |
| 16 | 40000  |
| 32 | 57000  |

There is [a formula](https://github.com/open-power/op-benchmark-recipes/blob/master/standard-benchmarks/HPL/Linpack_HPL.dat_tuning.md) to calculate the N.

The parameters NB determines, how big blocks are used for calculation. Its optimization is a bit of guesswork. It probably depends a lot on CPU caches and RAM speed. So in the example file you have 12 different NBs. The HPL will run for all of them and you can choose the one with the highest FLOPs.

Then just run `xhpl`. Sample output:

- The matrix A is randomly generated for each test.
- The following scaled residual check will be computed:
      ||Ax-b||_oo / ( eps * ( || x ||_oo * || A ||_oo + || b ||_oo ) * N )
- The relative machine precision (eps) is taken to be               1.110223e-16
- Computational tests pass if scaled residuals are less than                16.0

```
Sometimes instead of PASSED you can see FAILED, which means that the residual sums are higher than expected and your CPU calculated the result wrongly. It can be due to too high CPU frequency, not enough CPU voltage, or due to overheating.
Often the computer may also crash or restart. Which is also a sign of instability.

### Huge Pages
The Huge Pages can improve your FLOPs by approximately 10%. The easiest is to enable the Transparent Huge Pages (THP), if they are supported by your kernel. E.g. Raspberry Pi for some reason has THP disabled.

```
echo always | sudo tee /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled
echo always | sudo tee /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/defrag
echo 1 | sudo tee /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/use_zero_page
```

If you have more results, I can add them to the table.

According to [Wikiwand](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/FLOPS) and [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FLOPS) Cortex-A53, A55, A72, and A73 should have **2** FLOPs/cycle/core. Cortex-A57 **4** FLOPs/cycle/core and A76, A77, and A78 **8** FLOPs/cycle/core. So you can check that your ARM is reaching the correct FLOPs as it should.

I'm not sure, how to handle big.LITTLE archs as HPL distributes the tasks equally, so the faster cores will wait for the slower ones. The easiest is to test separately the big and then the LITTLE cluster using `taskset` to target the needed cores. In this case we will get correct FLOPs for the clusters, but we will not maximally stress the CPU.

### Notes

#### Raspberry Pi 4

Uses the aluminium Armor Case with Dual Fan. To achieve 1.8GHz on newer boards, you need `arm_boost=1` in `/boot/config.txt`. You can also specify `hdmi_enable_4kp60=1`, which increases the core frequency from 500MHz to 550MHz. The thermal throtling can be checked by `vcgencmd get_throttled`. The CPU temperature was under 62C and the thermal throttling was not reached.

#### Odroid-HC4

Set the fan speed to the maximum by `sudo systemctl stop fancontrol`. Verify by running `sensors`, you should see around 4500RPM and `/sys/class/hwmon/hwmon0/pwm1_enable` should be 0. The CPU temperature is under 63C.

#### Odroid-M1

I used a USB 10cm fan pointed on the passive heatsink. Temperature was under 47C.

Without the fan with just the stock passive heatsink oriented upwards the results are lower and more scattered. It indicates that there was a thermal throttling, even though the `/sys/devices/system/cpu/cpufreq/policy0/scaling_cur_freq` still reports the default frequency of 1.992GHz. The GFLOPs with only the passive cooling were 13.23, so the frequency probably dropped to 1.748GHz. The CPU temperature reached 69C.
